<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
                Shortest Job First (SJF) is a scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. It belongs to the family of non-preemptive scheduling algorithms where once a process starts executing, it runs to completion.

<h2>Types of SJF</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Preemptive SJF:</strong> Once a process starts executing, it continues until it finishes. The scheduler selects the process with the shortest burst time from the ready queue.</li>
<li><strong>Preemptive SJF:</strong> Also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), this variant allows the currently running process to be preempted if a new process with a shorter burst time enters the ready queue.</li>
</ul>

<section id="advantages">
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimizes average waiting time for processes.</li>
<li>Works well for both long and short processes, leading to optimal average turnaround time.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="disadvantages">
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requires knowledge of process burst times in advance, which is not always feasible in practical scenarios.</li>
<li>Can suffer from starvation for longer processes if shorter processes continually arrive.</li>
</ul>
