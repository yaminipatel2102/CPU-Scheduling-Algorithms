            <h2><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> FCFS Scheduling Algorithm</h2>
            
            <p>
                FCFS (First-Come, First-served) is the simplest type of scheduling algorithm in which processes are executed 
                based on their arrival time. The process that arrives first is executed first, followed by the next process 
                in the queue. It operates on a non-preemptive basis, meaning once a process starts executing, it continues 
                until it completes.
            </p>
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Characteristics of FCFS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-preemptive:</strong> Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple to implement:</strong> Easy to understand and code.</li>
                <li><strong>Convoy effect:</strong> Short processes may get stuck behind long processes.</li>
                <li><strong>No priority:</strong> Doesn't consider the burst time of processes for scheduling.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i> Advantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to understand and implement</li>
                <li>No starvation - Every process gets a chance to execute eventually</li>
                <li>Fair in the sense of first come, first served</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></i> Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor performance for short processes when long processes arrive first</li>
                <li>Not suitable for time-sharing systems</li>
                <li>May result in poor average turnaround time, especially with varying burst times</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Example:</h3>
            <p>
                Consider three processes arriving in the order P1, P2, P3 with burst times 24, 3, 3 respectively. 
                The average waiting time would be (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17ms, which is quite high due to the convoy effect.
            </p>
