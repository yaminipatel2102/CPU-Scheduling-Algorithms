<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
                Shortest Remaining Job First (SRTF), also known as Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF), is a scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time to execute next. Unlike SJF, SRTF can preempt a running process if a new process with a shorter burst time arrives in the ready queue.

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>
                In Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Processes are executed based on their remaining burst time, not their total burst time.</li>
<li>The scheduler selects the process with the smallest remaining time from the ready queue.</li>
<li>If a new process arrives with a shorter remaining time than the currently executing process, it preempts the running process.</li>
<li>The preempted process is placed back into the ready queue with its remaining time adjusted.</li>
<li>This continues until all processes are completed.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="advantages">
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimizes average waiting time for processes.</li>
<li>Provides better response time for shorter processes compared to non-preemptive algorithms.</li>
<li>Optimal for environments where new processes with shorter burst times frequently arrive.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="disadvantages">
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requires frequent context switching, which can lead to overhead.</li>
<li>Implementation complexity due to managing and updating remaining burst times dynamically.</li>
<li>May suffer from starvation for longer processes if shorter processes continually arrive.</li>
</ul>
